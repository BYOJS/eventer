<h1>Eventer: Tests</h1>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/byojs/eventer">Github</a></h3>

<hr>

<p>
	The automated tests run automatically, with results listed below.
</p>
<p>
	The "weak listener" tests are designed to be run interactively (likely on a desktop computer); they require you to initiate a GC (garbage collection) between <em>part 1</em> and <em>part 2</em>, as well as between <em>part 2</em> and <em>part 3</em>, of the tests.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>NOTE:</strong> Because of the unpredictability of GC, it's <em>possible</em> the browser might automatically perform a GC event between running the <em>part 1</em> tests and <em>part 2</em> tests, <strong>even if you didn't do so.</strong> As such, if you don't trigger the GC explicitly, it's possible that the <em>part 2</em> or <em>part 2</em> tests pass sometimes, but don't pass other times. However, if you trigger the GC explicitly, the <em>part 2</em> and <em>part 3</em> tests should always pass.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>To perform a manual GC in your browser:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>In Chrome, you'll need to have browser developer tools open and access the Memory tab</li>
	<li>In Firefox, you'll need to open <strong>about:memory</strong> in a separate tab</li>
</ul>
